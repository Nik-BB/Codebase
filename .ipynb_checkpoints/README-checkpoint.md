# Codebase
Reusable code used in mutiple PhD projects

The two main modules in this repository are DRP_nb and torch_nb. 

The DRP_nb module contains functionality specific to drug response prediction (DRP). Most importantly it contains data processing from raw data arrays/tensors that can be used in ML. 

The torch_nb module contains functionality for general PyTorch training and testing. Such as data loaders and training loops.
